## Overview
# HATAFormer: Hierarchically Adaptive Temporal Attention
 is an advanced attention-based architecture designed specifically for efficient and accurate multi-step time series forecasting. It builds on the HATFormer foundation and introduces innovative mechanisms to surpass the limitations of traditional Transformer-based and recent SOTA time series models like Informer, Longformer, and Crossformer.

## 🔍 Core Innovations

### 1. Dynamic Attention Mixing via Learnable Gating
Instead of using a fixed scalar \( \alpha \in [0,1] \) to blend local and global attention outputs, # HATAFormer: Hierarchically Adaptive Temporal Attention
 introduces a **learnable gating mechanism**:
- \( \alpha \) becomes a **trainable matrix** per head, timestep, or token.
- Gates are passed through a **sigmoid activation** to stay within \([0, 1]\).
- Enables fine-grained, data-driven control of locality vs. globality.

> **Benefit**: Better contextual adaptability across time, sequence length, and attention scale.

---

### 2. Sparse-Soft Hybrid Attention Masking
Rather than computing separate local and global attention passes, # HATAFormer: Hierarchically Adaptive Temporal Attention
 applies a **soft bias mask**:
- Incorporates a learned or scheduled bias \( \beta \cdot B_{\text{local}} \) into the attention logits.
- Encourages locality without hard-masking.
- Fully differentiable and memory-efficient.

> **Benefit**: Avoids redundant computation while preserving inductive locality bias.

---

### 3. Dual-Scale Attention via Head Splitting
Attention heads are **split** across local and global subspaces:
- Half of the heads attend with **local sliding window masks**.
- The other half perform **global full attention**.
- Results are concatenated and passed through a unified projection layer.

> **Benefit**: Specialization of attention heads to different temporal scales without additional compute cost.

---

### 4. Temporal-Aware Gating Control
Gating values \( \alpha \) can be **conditioned on temporal features** (e.g., hour, day, month):
- Uses temporal embedding vectors \( \phi(t) \) to dynamically adjust attention locality.
- Enables calendar-aware attention scaling.

> **Benefit**: The model adapts to seasonality and periodic patterns implicitly.

---

### 5. Decoder Cross-Step Refinement
After initial forecast outputs \( \hat{y}_{1:h} \), # HATAFormer: Hierarchically Adaptive Temporal Attention
 includes a **lightweight 1D self-attention block**:
- Refines cross-step correlations.
- Reduces prediction drift and smooths transitions.

> **Benefit**: Improves multi-step coherence and final output quality.

Rather than computing separate local and global attention passes, HATAFormer applies a **soft bias mask**:
- Incorporates a dynamic bias \( \beta \cdot B_{\text{local}} \) into the attention logits.
- **By default**, \( \beta \) is **learned** as a parameter.
- Optionally, a **scheduled** (non-trainable) bias curve can be used to simulate inductive locality at early training stages.
- Fully differentiable and memory-efficient.
